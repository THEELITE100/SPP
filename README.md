## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel with professional-grade features.

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Repository**
1. Make sure your code is pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Your project is already well-configured with a `vercel.json` file

#### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel**

**Option A: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Import your repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect settings

**Option B: Deploy via Vercel CLI**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```

#### **Step 3: Vercel Configuration Settings**

When deploying, use these exact settings:

**Framework Preset:**
- **Framework Preset:** `Create React App`
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (auto-detected)
- **Output Directory:** `build` (auto-detected)
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (auto-detected)

**Build & Output Settings:**
```
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: build
Install Command: npm install
```

**Advanced Settings:**
- **Node.js Version:** `18.x` (recommended)
- **Override:** None needed

#### **Step 4: Your `vercel.json` Configuration**

Your existing `vercel.json` is perfect and includes:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build",
  "framework": "create-react-app",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration:
- ‚úÖ Sets the correct build command
- ‚úÖ Specifies the output directory
- ‚úÖ Configures client-side routing (SPA support)
- ‚úÖ Handles all routes properly
- ‚úÖ Supports professional features

#### **Step 5: Deployment Process**

1. **Connect Repository:** Vercel will automatically detect your React app
2. **Build Process:** Vercel will run `npm install` then `npm run build`
3. **Deployment:** Your app will be deployed to a unique URL
4. **Custom Domain:** You can add a custom domain later

#### **Step 6: Post-Deployment**

After deployment:
1. **Test the Application:** Verify all features work:
   - Market Analysis (technical analysis)
   - Portfolio Analysis (comparison tools)
   - Risk Assessment (calculator)
   - Dark/Light mode toggle
   - Security search functionality
2. **Performance:** Vercel automatically optimizes your app
3. **Updates:** Future pushes to your main branch will auto-deploy

### Expected Deployment Time:
- **First deployment:** 2-3 minutes
- **Subsequent updates:** 30-60 seconds

### Troubleshooting Tips:

1. **If build fails:**
   - Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Ensure Node.js version is compatible (18.x recommended)

2. **If routing doesn't work:**
   - Your `vercel.json` already handles this with the rewrites rule

3. **If styles don't load:**
   - Tailwind CSS is properly configured and should work out of the box
